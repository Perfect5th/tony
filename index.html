        Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had been the
        only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in the long,
        long ago, before the goblins came, and he was cut off from his friends far under under the
        mountains. <strong>+1</strong>

        &ldquo;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total
        obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when
        it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there
        will be nothing. Only I will remain.&rdquo; <strong>-21</strong>

        &lsquo;Anyway – Harry,&rsquo; said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, &lsquo;a
        very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here – I mighta sat on it at some point, but
        it'll taste all right.&rsquo;<br />
        From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened
        it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with <em>Happy Birthday
        Harry</em> written on it in green icing. <strong>+11</strong>

        But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always
        been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off in the Blue. There he had
        undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end.
        The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf. <strong>+11</strong>

        Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a
        weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than seventeen.<br />
        &lsquo;Are you a ghost?&rsquo; Harry said uncertainly.<br />
        &lsquo;A memory.&rsquo; said Riddle quietly. &lsquo;Preserved in a diary for fifty
        years.&rsquo; <strong>+3</strong>

        &lsquo;A Dementor,&rsquo; said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else.
        &lsquo;One of the Dementors of Azkaban.&rsquo;<br />
        Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it
        in his pocket. <strong>+6</strong>

        The night sky brightened faintly in the east with the approach of dawn as the Chosen entered
        the Gardens of Life. Without, the Elven city of Arborlon lay sleeping, its people still
        wrapped in the warmth and solitude of their beds. But for the Chosen, the day had already
        begun. <strong>+20</strong>
